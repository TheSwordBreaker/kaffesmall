We know a thing or two about the best coffee here at Kiosk Kaffee. Here are some of our favourite (and most unexpected) coffee facts!<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Every Cup You Use Does An Impact<br \/>\nSeveral scientific investigations and Kiosk Kaffee experts have found that the colour, shape, and even texture of our cup influences how we enjoy coffee. For example, sipping cold coffee from a white cup at Kiosk Kaffee provides a stark contrast, leading us to believe our coffee is stronger. When we drink hot coffee from a black cup, many of us feel it to be lighter and sweeter.<\/p>\n<p>Second In The World<br \/>\nCoffee is so widely consumed that it is the world&#8217;s second most traded commodity, trailing only crude oil. After water, it is our most beloved beverage. It is worth well over $100 billion globally.<br \/>\nAnd proudly, Kiosk Kaffee has emerged as India\u2019s favourite coffee brand offering a deletable Kiosk menu including crunch cookies, brownies, pastries, mojitos and Kiosk coffees. <\/p>\n<p>Light Roast Coffee Contains A Bit More Caffeine<br \/>\nHave you ever wondered what the difference between light and dark roast coffee is, and whether dark roast is stronger than light roast?<br \/>\nYou gotta try what Kiosk Kaffee menu has to offer!<br \/>\nDark roast isn&#8217;t any stronger than light roast; in fact, light roast frequently has a bit more caffeine!<\/p>\n<p>Add Cream, Keep Your Coffee Warm<br \/>\nSpilling Kiosk Kaffee secrets: When you add cream to your coffee, it stays warm for 20% longer!<br \/>\nWe believe it has something to do with the principle that makes hot water more suitable for making ice cubes than cold water when you\u2019re in a hurry to cool down your fresh beverage.<\/p>\n<p>A Year Of Coffee Or An iPhone?<br \/>\nCoffee costs an average of $1,092 per year in the United States.

Consider again!<br \/>\nA cup of coffee contains more caffeine than an espresso shot. Espresso contains only approximately a third of the caffeine found in a cup of drip coffee. <\/p>\n<p>Coffee Is A Type Of Fruit<br \/>\nA coffee shrub produces coffee beans. They are a fruit since they are the pit of a berry. Beans are classified into two types: green and red. Red beans have a more pleasant aroma and are less acidic. They are utilised in the production of lighter coffees. The longer coffee beans are roasted, the healthier they become. Decaffeinated coffee is produced by a chemical procedure that removes the caffeine from the beans. Caffeine is frequently sold to Coca-Cola, a large buyer.<\/p>\n<p>Coffee Cup Guinness World Record<br \/>\nHere&#8217;s something you probably didn&#8217;t know about coffee!
